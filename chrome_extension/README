The chrome extension will fact check a claim in a Breitbart news article when you highlight it.
I've used the FEVER Wiki articles as the source for reference facts, and our IR system as the backend search.
Takuma's inference and aggregation models are then applied to the claim and evidence. 
Thanks to David, Sebastiao, Hina and Alex for the front end Javascript stuff.


To get the chrome extension to work, you need to:
    put the required certificates in a certs folder in the main fever directory
        I've included the certs I used, but I don't know if that will work
        I created them like this:
            $ openssl genrsa 1024 > ssl.key
            $ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key ssl.key > ssl.cert
    put ir_app.py in the main fever directory and run it
        you need to have downloaded the wikipages into the data directory and created:
            edocs.bin
            doc_ir_model.bin
            line_ir_model.bin
            doctitles
    get Takuma's fork of Jack: https://github.com/takuma-ynd/jack
    put aggregator.pt and infagg.py into the main jack directory and run it
        you need a trained reader
    load the extension
        goto extensions within settings
        switch on developer mode
        click 'load unpacked' and point chrome at the extension folder
    convince chrome to talk to the IR app
        type something like 'https://0.0.0.0:5000/api/evidence?claim=this is a claim' into the address bar
        and then tell chrome to ignore the security issues
    open a breitbart article and highlight a claim in the story
